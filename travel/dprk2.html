		<h3>North Korea, Part 2 - How?</h3>
		<p>So, we have covered the <a href="../travel/dprk1.html">Why?</a>, but now onto the How?</p>
		<p>North Korea is actually quite easy to get into. Well, I say 'quite', it is much easier than you would at first think to get into. Let's start by going over the methods to getting there, which are only two. Train and plane.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3>Train</h3>
				<p>The trains into North Korea all go via China, as it is the only country to have a land route into the Korean peninsula. There are a couple of cities along the North Korean/China border called <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=dandong&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x5e2affbe3e9ca381:0x252c8f65e8177087,Dandong,+Liaoning,+China&gl=se&ei=wz5NUoWcE-n_4QSO3IHIDA&ved=0CMMBELYD" target="_blank">Dandong</a> and  <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=sinuiju&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x5e2afe38ccd630eb:0xd9765aa741246bf5,Sinuiju,+Nordkorea&gl=se&ei=MUBNUofEDoTP4QS8yYGoDg&ved=0CK8BELYD" target="_blank">Sinuiju</a>. All trains that go into North Korea containing tourists will go through these checkpoints.</p>
				<p>There are a couple of starting points for the trains too. You can get the train from either Beijing or Moscow. The trains from Moscow will go through somewhere called <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Zabaikalsk&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x5dd746082dfd864b:0xcf06d84260aba9a3,Zabaykalsk,+Zabaykalsky+Krai,+Ryssland&gl=se&ei=4EFNUrf8D4vn4QTy_IHwDw&ved=0CKwBELYDMA4" target="_blank">Zabaikalsk</a> on the Russia/China border. Considering the distance between Moscow and Pyongyang (as the soon to be exhausted crow flies) is roughly <a href="../images/travel/dprk2/img1.png" target="_blank">6,500 kilometers</a>, that would put you on a train for approximately 5 days, if you went in a perfectly straight line. The actual travel time from Moscow to Pyongyang is one week. I imagine you would get an unparallelled view of the countryside of Russia, China and North Korea though. Maybe I should try it the next time I go back, but for my first trip to North Korea, I opted for the 2 hour flight from Beijing covered below.</p>
				<p>Also, Americans are not allowed into the country via train.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Plane</h3>
				<p>Flights travel between Beijing, Shenyang, and Vladivostok at various times throughout the week, but not on what you would call a hectic schedule. The flights are usually on the North Korean ariline, Air Koryo. Air Koryo reitred their ageing fleet of planes and acquired significant upgrades in terms of safety, fuel efficiency and modernity around 2008, so thankfully I was not likely to fall into the East China Sea at any point. Air China also conduct some flights from Beijing and back, but only 3 times a week. It was an Air China plane I was going to board on my way there co-incidentally.</p>
				<p>The flight time is only a couple of hours from Beijing and distance wise, falls in around a measly 800km.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>But really, how?</h3>
		<p>Yes the whole "How did you get let in?" question. Well actually pretty much anyone can get into North Korea. There are some restrictions of course, such as the strange 'No Americans via train' rule, but pretty much anyone with a passport can go to North Korea on holiday. North Korea is a changing country, that may not be visible from the outside, but there are 35,000 tourists per year to the country. That is actually a LOT of tourism for a country famous for being so staunchly independant from the rest of the world.</p>
		<p>It is of course down to money. North Korea faced a devastating famine in the early '90s that killed millions of people. They had to open up their trading with outside countries by a tiny fraction to allow aid and goods from China in so that they could feed their people. Over time that gap has grown, and the flow of Euros and Dollars into the country continues. With Euro's the North Korean Government can buy commodities that they lack and ship them back home, all while maintaining their guise of isolationism. And they do exactly that.</p>
		<p>So actually to get into North Korea on holiday all you have to do is book a tour with one of the approved tour agencies and fill out some paperwork. OK, a bit more than 'some' paperwork.</p>
		<p>Tour operators can be found in many places. I live in Stockholm, and there is one that has been operating tours for a decade or so called <a href="http://www.koreakonsult.com/index_eng.html" target="_blank">Korea Konsult</a> that I chose to book with. There is one in China called <a href="http://www.koryogroup.com/">Koryo tours</a>, and a few in various other countries, even the U.S.A. has a tour agency.</p>
		<p>So now you know that it is entirely possible to get into the country. In fact there are various tours to choose from, ranging in length from the shortest at 4 nights, to the longest at 10 nights. These are just the group tours too, there are individual tours available that you might be able to take for even longer time periods. They are all part of a tour group though, which brings me to the next point.</p>
		<p><b>You cannot just wander around in North Korea on your own. If you try to enter the country via any means other than the official routes, it is possible that you will get shot.</b></p>
		<p>This is starting to sound a lot more like the North Korea that we have all heard about isn't it? And it is. If you choose to go to North Korea, you will go as part of an organised tour. There is no other way. There is no backpacking around and camping in the wilderness. It is the strictly organised tour and nothing else. If you want freedom in a holiday, this is not for you in any way what-so-ever.</p>
		<p>When you go to North Korea on one of these tours, you are assigned 3 people that will be with you through the entire trip. Your Driver, who may or may not speak whatever your native language is, or English either. Your tour guide who will most definately speak your native language, and your 'other' tour guide. By 'other' I mean the member of the North Korean Secret Police that accompanies you round everywhere you go.</p>
		<h3>Paperwork & Visas</h3>
		<p>Unsuprisingly, there is a <b>LOT</b> of paperwork to go through before you can get into the country. I'll list out the process and actual amount of paperwork below in a few lists. Whichever way you get into North Korea, it is going to be via China (unless it's via Vladivostock Airport, which is unlikely). This means you also need a dual entry Chinese Visa too. That entails, even more paperwork than getting a Visa into North Korea. I thought this very strange at first, but I imagine it is because the Tour Agency you go with is actually the one that has to process your paperwork once you have paid for the tour.</p>
		<h4>North Korean Visa Requirements</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Passport currently valid and valid after your trip for at least 6 months.</li>
			<li>A signed letter of confirmation of employment from your employer.</li>
			<li>A scan of the photo section of your passport.</li>
			<li>2 x Passport sized photos (white background, no glasses or hats etc).</li>
			<li>Completed DPRK visa application form.</li>
			<li>Signed letter confirming your intention to go only for reasons of tourism and no other reason. It looks like <a href="../images/travel/dprk2/img2.png" target="_blank">this</a>.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>This is not such a huge amount of paperwork really, and most of them can be completed with minimal fuss. The Chinese Visa paperwork was significantly more difficult to complete, purely due to the quantity. Also the dual entry visas are slightly more bureaucratic in their nature to acquire.</p>
		<h4>Chinese Dual Entry Visa Requirements</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Passport currently valid and valid after your trip for at least 6 months.</li>
			<li>A signed letter of confirmation of employment from your employer.</li>
			<li>A scan of the photo section of your passport.</li>
			<li>A 'Personbevis', a confirmation of your existance from the government.</li>
			<li>A copy of your flight confirmation bookings into and out of the country.</li>
			<li>A copy of your hotel bookings in all major cities that you intend to stay in during your trip.</li>
			<li>An itinerary detailing what you will be doing during your stay with attractions you intend to visit, and the duration of your stay in each area, and if applicable, the types of transport you will be taking within China.</li>
			<li>A completed Visa Application form. This one is a <b>monster</b> weighing in at well over 13 pages of forms, each of which must be filled out precisely with zero room for error.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The Visa Application form also includes a section at the end in-case you are applying for a visa from a country that you are resident in, but do not hold citizenship of. Like me really. It also, in this area, asks for the number of your residence permit. If you are an EU citizen living in another EU country, you do not have a 'residence permit', but an agreed upon 'right of residence' that applies throughout the EU. This means that you do not have a number to enter into this field. As it is a form on an internet page with validation, this means that you also cannot submit the form to the Chinese Embassy without a number in this field. Catch 22 it would seem. You can, however, just put a period in the field and submit it so that it will at elast allow you to print it, and take it to the Embassy to acquire the visa. You can then give the problem to a bureaucrat who will deal with it by entereing your passport number.</p>
		<p>The process for getting the entire trip confirmed was very easy in retrospect, although there were a few panics along the way such as wondering if I had to get a transit visa for Russia for my proposed 90 minutes stop-over there (I did not), and the point where the tour agency emailed me asking where my passport was (I had forgotten to send it. Otherwise it went something like this.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Email tour agency and express interest in tour.</li>
			<li>Make payment of 50% of the total cost of the tour by bank transfer.</li>
			<li>Book flight from Stockholm to Beijing, and Shanghai to Stockholm via Moscow.</li>
			<li>Book Hotels in Beijing and Shanghai.</li>
			<li>Apply for Chinese Visa after completing all paperwork.</li>
			<li>Pay remaining 50% of Tour price.</li>
			<li>Send off Passport with Chinese dual entry visa to Tour agency along with all necessary paperwork for North Korean Visa.</li>
			<li>Recieve Passport and Fly to Beijing.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>That was pretty much it. As I said it is much easier to get into than many people think. There are a LOT more tourists than you would at first imagine. When I saw the Arirang Mass Games for the first time on Youtube, I started researching how to get into the country and what I would find once I got there, and found the same video that most people who have been on the internet found. <a href="http://www.vice.com/the-vice-guide-to-travel/vice-guide-to-north-korea-1-of-3" target="blank">The Vice Documentary</a> that was filmed some time in 2007. I would highly reccomend this as viewing for anyone willing to see more of this eccentric country, along with the fantastic <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456012/" target="_blank">A State Of Mind</a> documentary.</p>
		<p>The last bit of research I did was to watch a film called <b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089851/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank">Pulgasari</a></b>. Pulgasari has an interesting history behind it. Kim Jong-il, who wanted to kick-start the North Korean film industry, ordered the North Korean intelligence service to kidnap a renown South Korean film director by the name of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Sang-ok" target="_blank">Shin Sang-ok</a> and force him to come to North Korea to make films. This was achieved by his recently divorced wife being kidnapped in Hong Kong, and shipped off to North Korea. When Shin went to Hong Kong to find out what had happened to her, he was also kidnapped. After about 5 years in a North Korean prison, he was taken to meet Kim Jong-il who told him the reasons for his kidnap and ordered him to start directing films, which he did. The most famous of these is Pulgasari. It is an attempt at a Godzilla-style movie, but with a North Korean budget. The Godzilla-style monster grows from a metal figurine size to Godzilla size throughout the movie, and at one point is very obviously <a href="../images/travel/dprk2/img3.gif" target="_blank">a midget in a Godzilla suit</a>. The special effects are also <a href="../images/travel/dprk2/img4.png" target="_blank">something else</a>, and the screenwriting is <a href="../images/travel/dprk2/img5.png" target="_blank">just as bad</a>.</p>
		<p>Pulgasari is actually avaialbe to download on the internet, and I highly reccomend that you acquire it somehow. I asked if it was available in North Korea, and they actually told me to download it from the internet. Also, do not worry about Shin, he and his wife (they re-married at the 'suggestion' of Kim Jong-il) escaped during a film festival in Venice, and sought political asylum.</p>
		<p>The next post will be about my journey to North Korea, and my first day there, including the Arirang Mass Games, and hopefully be up soon.</p>
