		<h3>North Korea, Part 1 - Why?</h3>
		<p>This first post about my recent trip to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) or North Korea, is actually just going to focus on <i>why</i> I actually wanted to go. I know people want to hear about all the concentration camps, the salt mines and other oddities, including just how I got a visa to go in the first place, but all that will come in later posts. For now, I want to talk about what fascniated me with North Korea to the extent that I wanted to visit the so called 'Hermit Kingdom'.</p>
		<p>It was the Arirang Mass Games.</p>
		<p>The first ever time I saw them was on Youtube in about 2004. I knew then that I absolutely had to go and see this place, no matter how difficult it would be to get in, no matter how much it was going to cost me. Both of these things actually turned out to be much less than I initially anticipated.</p>
		<p>Here is a video of what I am talking about.</p>

		<iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/QyHzNnz8O88" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

		<p>There is a point in that video, around the 50 second mark, where the entire screen at the back changes to a picture of the countries 'Eternal President' Kim Il Sung. That is not a screen. That is actually 30,000 schoolchildren all holding up a book with colours on each page. Every child forms a pixel, and at the drop of a hat, will change the page of the book they are holding to a new page, and make that giant image you see. <b> That </b> is why I wanted to go to North Korea.</p>
		<p>I will make more of these posts as this website comes along. I have learned a lot about styling, html and other stuff whilst making this site, and the only reason I did all this was to be able to tell this story to more than one person at a time.</p>
		<p>I must ask you to be patient though, as it does take a lot of time to build a website. Bearing in mind that I am only using a text editor, and an FTP client to make this. No other tools or programs at all. I wanted to experience the learning curve in all it's glory. On top of that I have yet to organise all my photos and videos from North Korea too, so content may be a while in coming. I will update the front page as new posts are made though.</p>
